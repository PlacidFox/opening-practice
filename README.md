# Chess Opening Practice

Chess Repertoire Training app to randomly test knowldege of your own opening repertoire

Still in developpement
This project is made for me to learn JavaScript


Using : JS for UI, Python/Flask for Backend

Current state :
- display initial pieces
- capture moves (only pieces of the color to play)
- moves pieces & delete captured pieces
- switch side
- show all moves at the side (only if start at 1 and white)
- random select of a lign to be tested with (no sidelines of the momment)

Next-Steps :
- when Death Match - stop the game
- click restart & relaunch test 
- //fail_safe  & deach_match to put in a ENUM ?
- Castle & en passant

To do :
- input chess rules and moves with class
- put board with fen (start black and not at move 1 ?)
- legal moves ? or not necessary ?
- show check ?
- show moves if not start at 1. & white
- replay mode to show each preparation play automaticaly




Clock for time test

Get Better : 
- add possibilities of sidelines in prep
#split uci moves into from_coordinates et to_coordinates - #COLOR STILL MANUEL IN CODE - TO DO BETTER - AND GET MOVE NUMBER IF BLACK START ?


Comments : 
- only work with game start at init board
- only work if a single choice as a given opponent move
