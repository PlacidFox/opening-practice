# Chess Opening Practice

Chess Repertoire Training app to randomly test knowldege of your own opening repertoire

Still in developpement
This project is made for me to learn JavaScript


Using : JS for UI, Python/Flask for Backend

Current state :
- display initial pieces
- capture moves (only pieces of the color to play)
- moves pieces & delete captured pieces
- switch side

Next-Steps :
- show all moves at the side ? (format UCI pour le moment ?)
- JSON of moves to compare to played me Console Log if OK then only if ok allow to play (or else put in red ?)
- in JSON nb moves also for PGN notation to show in UI ? and number also ?
- reverse board

    

To do :
- legal moves ? or not necessary ?
- show check ?

Get Better : 
#split uci moves into from_coordinates et to_coordinates - #COLOR STILL MANUEL IN CODE - TO DO BETTER - AND GET MOVE NUMBER IF BLACK START ?


Comments : 
- only work with game start at init board
